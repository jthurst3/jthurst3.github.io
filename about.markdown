I am a Software Engineer at [Mineral](https://mineral.ai), the newest graduated company at Alphabet (as of January 2023), focused on making the world's food system more sustainable. Prior to this, I worked at an internal Google Research/AI group that helps teams across Google and Alphabet gather high quality data to train machine learning models. I graduated from the University of Rochester Computer Science program in 2017.

My mission is to help find original solutions to reverse the effects of climate change and promote sustainability. I am eager to brainstorm action-oriented solutions with people and help get more of us involved in this work. If you have ideas or would like to connect, please reach out to me via [email](mailto:jht9663@gmail.com).
