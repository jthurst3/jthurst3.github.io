I am a Software Engineer at [X](https://x.company), part of Alphabet that helps create new technologies to solve the world's hardest problems. Prior to this, I worked at an internal Google AI group that helped teams across the company gather high quality data to train machine learning models. I graduated from the University of Rochester Computer Science program in 2017.

My mission is to help find original solutions to reverse the effects of climate change and promote sustainability. I am eager to brainstorm action-oriented solutions with people and help get more people involved in this work. If you have ideas or would like to connect, feel free to reach out to me via email, which can be found at the bottom of the page.
