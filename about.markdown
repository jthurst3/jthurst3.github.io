I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Mineral](https://mineral.ai), a newly graduated company at Alphabet, using perception and AI to help make the world's food system more sustainable. Prior to this, I worked at an internal Google Research/AI group that helps teams across Alphabet gather high quality data to train machine learning models. I graduated from the University of Rochester Computer Science program.
